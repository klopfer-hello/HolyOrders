# Changelog

Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) /
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Sync protocol
bumps are called out — mismatched clients ignore each other's messages.

### Added
- `/ho peers` lists legacy blessing-addon clients and their free-assignment
  state.

- Skins can change the font — third-party skins too.

## [0.31.0] - 2026-07-30

### Added
- Pre-planning: assign paladins before they join — **+** button or
  `/ho expect <name>`, with name autocompletion; applies on arrival.

- No-Salvation mode ends when leaving the group.

### Changed

## [0.29.1] - 2026-07-25

### Fixed
- Legacy clients no longer flicker: broadcasts only go out on real changes.

## [0.29.0] - 2026-07-25

Relaxed party permissions apply fully once every client runs 0.29+.

## [0.28.0] - 2026-07-25

  Wisdom on mana pets (needs everyone on 0.27+).
- `/ho peers` lists incompatible clients and who must update.

### Changed
- Buffs count as expiring under 5 minutes (was 2).

### Added
